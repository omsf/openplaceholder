    substructure-match template that aligns two molecules differing only in
    protonation state (an input molecule against a Dimorphite-DL microstate of

    Bond orders and aromaticity are preserved -- they are what distinguishes,
    say, an amidine's ``=N`` from its ``-N``, so flattening them would let the
    charge/H mapping land on the wrong nitrogen and blow up its valence.
    Only formal charges, explicit Hs and radicals are cleared, and implicit
    Hs are switched off so a neutralized cation can't overflow its valence.

    Crucially we do *not* run a full sanitize: re-kekulizing a neutralized
    aromatic cation such as a protonated pyridinium ``[nH+]`` is what made the
    indazole/imidazole molecules fail. The molecule keeps the aromaticity
    perceived at parse time, and a light property-cache/ring refresh is all

    Dimorphite returns every microstate whose pKa falls within the

    runs, so taking `states[0]` makes the pipeline non-deterministic:
    e.g. a secondary alkyl amide can come back as either NH or N-, and
    we'd silently flip between them on re-runs.

    Selection happens in two tiers (lower is better):

    1. **Site-by-site plausibility.** Each candidate is aligned to the
       input atom-by-atom and its formal-charge changes are checked: a
       cation must form on a nitrogen base, an anion on an O/S acid or a
       genuinely acidic nitrogen (sulfonamide, tetrazole, ...). Dimorphite
       also enumerates implausible microstates -- most notably a
       deprotonated carboxamide ``C(=O)[N-]`` (N-H pKa ~17-22) -- and those
       are penalised by their count of illegitimate changes, so the neutral
       amide is kept over its bogus anion.

    2. **Most ionized.** Among equally plausible candidates, prefer the one
       with the greatest total ionic character (sum of |formal charge|).
       When dimorphite is unsure it returns both the ionized and the neutral
       form (a primary amine comes back as both ``CCC[NH3+]`` and ``CCCN``);
       this keeps the ionized one and, unlike "match the input charge", does
       not collapse back to a neutral input drawn without explicit charges. A
       zwitterion (net charge 0 but two charged atoms) is preferred over its
       neutral form.

    The SMILES string is a final deterministic tiebreak. For groups with
    pKa far from the pH window dimorphite returns a single state, so the
